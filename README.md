Linux utilies written in python

The goal of this project is to create useful utilies for my Linux device using python
I am currently using Debian 13 with i3 as my window manager.

For this project to be considered succesful I need to gather and display...

1. System Info
    - CPU Usage
    - Mem Usage
    - Disk Usage
2. Process Manager
    - List all running processes
    - Kill a process by PID
    - Search process by name
3. File Organizer
    - Clean old temporary files
4. Network Tools
    - List active network interfaces
    - Scan local network for connected devices
    - Scan for open ports
5. Local Logging
    - Store logs locally
